# Visualizations

Interactive matplotlib visualizations to understand gradient descent:

- **1D Gradient Descent**: Visualize how gradient descent finds the minimum of a 1D function
- **2D Gradient Descent**: Compare Batch GD vs Stochastic GD on a loss surface with:
  - 3D surface plot
  - 2D contour plot
  - Interactive controls (learning rate, starting position, play/pause)  

  You can go to the code and choose to represent the 3D loss function and gradient of the 2 neurons network (`2_neurons_learning.py`)
