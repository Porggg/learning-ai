# Neural Networks from Scratch

Learning neural networks by building everything from scratch to understand how they work under the hood.

## Learning Progress

### 1. Two Neurons Network (`2_neurons_learning.py`)

A minimal neural network with just 2 neurons (1 input, 1 output) learning a simple classification task:
- **Task**: Return 0 if input < 0.5, return 1 otherwise
- **Architecture**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation
- **Training**: Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Loss function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 2. Three Neurons Network (`3_neurons_learning.py`)

Expanding to 2 neurons architecture with a hidden layer.
